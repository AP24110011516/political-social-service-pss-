# AI Tools Used
This project leverages AI tools to support ideation, documentation, and system planning, ensuring clarity, structure, and efficiency during development.
## ChatGPT
ChatGPT was used as an AI assistance tool for:
- Refining the problem statement and project vision
- Structuring the solution approach and feature set
- Generating clear documentation (README, problem statement, reproducibility steps)
- Designing the high-level system architecture and data flow
- Improving clarity, precision, and presentation for hackathon evaluation
ChatGPT was used strictly as a **supporting tool** for reasoning, planning, and documentation. All final decisions, validations, and implementations were performed by the project team.
## Role of AI in the Project
AI tools were not used to automate governance decisions or replace human judgment. Instead, they were used to:
- Accelerate idea refinement
- Improve documentation quality
- Ensure consistency across project artifacts

This approach maintains transparency, ethical use of AI, and human accountability.

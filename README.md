## Problem Statement

There is no transparent and inclusive digital platform for citizens to collectively raise local issues, track representative responses, or understand how public funds are utilized. This lack of visibility and accountability leads to unresolved grievances, inefficient governance, and reduced public trust.

## Solution Overview

This project proposes a government-controlled digital platform that enables citizens to publicly raise governance-related issues, participate through voting or reactions, and track responses from elected representatives. The platform ensures transparency, inclusiveness for non-digital users through Panchayat offices, and data-driven accountability in governance.
